# Python-Scripting-for-hackers
This is a special project based on python scripting in the shell for hackers
& also this GitHub repository is made up of several code fragments in a shell fashion that contributes to the programmer knowledge in agile environments.

(The point)

Description:
Is important to realize that the solid fundamentals are based on the shell scripting and is a versatile and agile python environment that allows us to access insecure data and tests across python, even https servers. The shell is sometimes more useful than writing several long snippets that causes many errors in the Linux terminal console etcâ€¦ then I decided to get deeper into the fundamentals of cybersecurity with python and Rubyfu book in order to build a more sophisticate and complete vision of the terminal rather than just code long fragments that usually cause headaches in the programming field and many errors that in agile environments such ethical-hacking works (long scripts and unsupported versions and dependencies are not useful for gain agility such a hacker does) 

My philosophy is made simple complicate things such access points to the different servers and using curl or postman to learn APIs in a more simple way and point accessing. But this time the important thing for working with scripts is a basic knowledge of crypto-hash stuff that you can reach in many degree mathematical courses and other TERMUX repositories. I encourage you to learn cryptography and hashing with TERMUX, which is a terminal for ANDROID. Is advantageous for cryptography because hackers in the day-to-day internet flows they write handy automation scripts for crypto hashes and the python shell materials.
